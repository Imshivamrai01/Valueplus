 * Allocates the next document number from what is actually stored.
 *
 * The billing modal used to build this client-side as
 *   `SVAK2026RI` + (cached invoice list length + 602)
 * which produced a number that already existed: the list endpoint hides
 * sales-orders, the offset was a magic constant, and any deleted or failed bill
 * shifted the count. The POST route then matched the existing invoice number and
 * returned that OLD invoice as a "success", so the counter printed a bill that
 * was never saved. Numbering therefore has to come from the database maximum.
