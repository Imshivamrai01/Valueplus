/**
 * Export a flat array of objects to a real .xlsx file — same signature as the
 * old `downloadCSV(data, filename)`, so every existing call site swaps in with
 * almost no change. Unlike CSV, columns are sized to fit their content, and a
 * genuine number (not a formatted string like "₹1,234") keeps its numeric type
 * instead of becoming quoted text Excel can't sum.
 *
 * No header styling (bold, fill colour): the `xlsx` community package this
 * app already depends on writes a cell's `.s` style object but silently drops
 * it — confirmed by round-tripping a written file, not assumed from the docs.
 * Making the header row bold for real needs a styling-capable fork
 * (`xlsx-js-style`), a separate dependency this task doesn't call for.
