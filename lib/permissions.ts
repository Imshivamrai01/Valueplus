/**
 * Central role → permission map for the ledger, PIN-authorised and audit features.
 *
 * Access control used to live in exactly one place: the sidebar filtered its links
 * by `role` (see components/layout/sidebar.tsx). That hides a menu entry but stops
 * nobody — the page still renders if the URL is typed by hand, and the API route
 * behind it never looked at the session at all. Money-bearing screens (party
 * ledgers, void audit) need a real answer, so every new check routes through here
 * and is enforced in three places: the sidebar, the page (RoleGuard) and the API
 * (requirePermission).
 *
 * Nothing that already worked is gated by this file. Existing routes keep their
 * current behaviour; only the features added alongside this map consult it.
